"""Import module backward compatible
Maintaining old import paths is available to avoid damaging existing codes

Methods of use:
# The old code can still be imported
It's not like you're going to have to go to NewsData.
You know, from traffickingagents.

# The new code recommends a new path
It's not like you're talking to me.
It's a lot of work.

#It exists to alert developers to new import paths
